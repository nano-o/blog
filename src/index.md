I am interested in distributed-systems analysis, design, and implementation aided by formal methods. For example, I have recently worked on formally verifying BFT-consensus algorithms such as [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/spec/tree/master/ivy-proofs) and the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](https://github.com/stellar/scp-proofs).

I work for the Stellar Development Foundation.

You can email me at giuliano at losa.fr for personal matters and at giuliano at stellar.org for work-related matters.

I also have a [one-post blog](blog/) on this website.

## FRIDA Workshop

I helped organize the [2021 Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms (FRIDA)](https://frida-2021.github.io/). You can find the videos of the talks on Youtube: [Monday's session](https://youtu.be/EzxiDResQUE) and [Friday's session](https://youtu.be/m8ApDWtmB14).

In 2020, Marijana Lazić and myself organized the "[2020 Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms (FRIDA)](https://frida2020.galois.com/). You can find the videos of the talks on the [QONFEST YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9p1Z8nIPTP4Uv5Qodb1og/videos) (search for FRIDA in video titles).
